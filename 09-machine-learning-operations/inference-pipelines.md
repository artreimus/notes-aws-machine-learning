### What are Inference Pipelines?

**Inference pipelines** allow you to chain together multiple inference containers (Docker images) in a linear sequence—between 2 and 15 containers—to perform a complete end-to-end inference workflow. Instead of using a single container to handle all steps of prediction, you can break the process into distinct stages such as pre-processing, model inference, and post-processing.

### How Do Inference Pipelines Work?

- **Chaining Containers:**  
  Each container in the pipeline performs a specific function. For example, one container may normalize or pre-process incoming data, the next container executes the model’s prediction logic, and a final container might format the output or apply business logic before returning the result.

- **Data Flow:**  
  The output of one container becomes the input for the next. This modular design helps you isolate different processing steps, making it easier to manage and update parts of your inference workflow independently.

- **Multiple Frameworks Supported:**  
  You can mix and match containers—using built-in algorithms, custom models, or even containers from frameworks like scikit-learn, Spark ML, and others. For example, you might use a Spark ML container for pre-processing and a deep learning container for inference.

- **Deployment Modes:**  
  Inference pipelines work with both real-time inference endpoints (for interactive, low-latency predictions) and batch transforms (for processing large volumes of data at once).

### Why Use Inference Pipelines?

- **Modularity:**  
  Breaking the inference workflow into discrete, reusable components makes maintenance and updates easier.

- **Flexibility:**  
  You can combine different pre-processing, inference, and post-processing steps tailored to your application requirements.

- **Scalability:**  
  Whether you're handling real-time API calls or processing batches of data, inference pipelines can be adapted to fit your workload.

- **Enhanced Functionality:**  
  They allow you to incorporate custom logic and even integrate built-in SageMaker algorithms alongside your own code—all packaged as Docker containers stored in ECR.

### Key Exam Points

- **Definition:**  
  Inference pipelines are a way to combine multiple Docker containers—each handling a different aspect of the inference process—into a single cohesive pipeline.

- **Use Cases:**  
  They are useful when you need to apply complex workflows, such as chaining pre-processing, inference, and post-processing steps, especially when different containers may be required for different tasks.

- **Deployment Options:**  
  Inference pipelines can be used for both real-time inference (via endpoints) and for batch transforms.

- **Limitations:**  
  The pipeline can include between 2 and 15 containers. The containers must be orchestrated so that the output of one stage is correctly formatted for the next.

### Conclusion

For the exam, remember that inference pipelines in SageMaker enable you to:

- **Chain multiple containers** (pre-processing, model prediction, post-processing) together.
- **Build modular and flexible inference workflows** that can serve both real-time and batch inference needs.
- **Support mixed frameworks and custom logic** by leveraging Docker containers stored in ECR.

Understanding this concept is key to grasping how SageMaker supports complex inference scenarios beyond simple single-container deployments.
