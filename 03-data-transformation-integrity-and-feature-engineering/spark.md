# What is Apache Spark?

**Apache Spark** is an open-source, distributed computing engine designed for fast, large-scale data processing. It is widely used for big data analytics, data engineering, and machine learning tasks.

## Key Features

- **In-Memory Processing:**  
  Spark processes data in memory, which makes it much faster than traditional disk-based engines like Hadoop MapReduce.
- **Distributed Computing:**  
  Spark can scale across many nodes in a cluster, enabling efficient processing of massive datasets.
- **Rich Ecosystem:**  
  Includes libraries for SQL (Spark SQL), machine learning (MLlib), graph processing (GraphX), and stream processing (Spark Streaming).
- **Language Support:**  
  Supports Python, Scala, Java, and R APIs, making it accessible to a wide range of developers and data scientists.

## Relevance to Machine Learning

- **Data Preprocessing:**  
  Spark is commonly used to clean, transform, and aggregate large datasets before training ML models.
- **Distributed ML Training:**  
  With MLlib, Spark enables scalable training of machine learning algorithms across clusters.
- **Integration with AWS:**  
  Spark is available on Amazon EMR, allowing seamless integration with AWS storage and ML services like SageMaker.

## Typical Use Cases

- ETL (Extract, Transform, Load) pipelines for big data.
- Feature engineering and data preparation for ML.
- Large-scale model training and evaluation.
- Real-time analytics and streaming data processing.
