Imputing missing data means **filling in the blanks** in a dataset where some values are missing.

Instead of deleting incomplete rows or columns, imputation replaces missing values with _estimated_ ones, based on the rest of the data. This helps keep as much information as possible and improves the accuracy of models.

### Common imputation methods:

1. **Mean/Median/Mode Imputation**: Fill missing values with the columnâ€™s average (mean), middle value (median), or most common value (mode).
2. **Forward/Backward Fill**: Use the previous or next value to fill in the missing one (often used with time series).
3. **K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN)**: Estimate the missing value based on similar (nearest) data points.
4. **Regression Imputation**: Predict the missing value using a regression model built from the other variables.
5. **Multivariate Imputation (e.g. MICE)**: Iteratively predict missing values using multiple models.
