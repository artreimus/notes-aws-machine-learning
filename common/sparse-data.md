In machine learning, **sparse data** refers to datasets where a significant proportion of the values are zeros or nulls. This sparsity often arises in scenarios involving high-dimensional data, such as text analysis, recommendation systems, or gene expression studies, where each observation contains only a small subset of possible features.

It's important to distinguish between sparse data and missing data. While sparse data consists of known zero values indicating the absence or non-occurrence of certain features, missing data pertains to unknown or unrecorded values. For example, in a movie recommendation system, a zero might indicate that a user has not rated a particular movie (sparse data), whereas a missing value would suggest that the rating information is unavailable (missing data).

Handling sparse data presents unique challenges in machine learning. Models trained on sparse datasets may struggle with increased complexity, reduced representativeness, and a higher risk of overfitting. Specialized techniques and algorithms are often required to effectively process and analyze sparse data, ensuring that the models can generalize well to new, unseen data.
