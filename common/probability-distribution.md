# Probability Distributions

A **probability distribution** is just a rule that tells us how likely each possible outcome of a random event is. Flip a coin: there’s a 50 % chance of heads and a 50 % chance of tails. Those two numbers (0.5 and 0.5) are the probability distribution for that coin flip—it must always add up to **1 (100 %)**.

## 1 · Discrete vs. Continuous

| Idea         | Discrete                     | Continuous                                      |
| ------------ | ---------------------------- | ----------------------------------------------- |
| **Outcomes** | Separate “jumps” (0, 1, 2 …) | Any value on a number line (2.37 s, 8.001 kg …) |
| **Picture**  | Dots or bars                 | Smooth curve                                    |
| **Example**  | Number of goals in a game    | Height of students                              |

## 2 · Common Discrete Distributions

| Name          | Everyday Picture                            | What it Answers                           |
| ------------- | ------------------------------------------- | ----------------------------------------- |
| **Uniform**   | Rolling a fair die (1–6 all equally likely) | “Every outcome has the same chance.”      |
| **Bernoulli** | One coin flip (success = heads)             | “Will it be success (1) or failure (0)?”  |
| **Binomial**  | Ten coin flips                              | “How many successes out of _n_ tries?”    |
| **Poisson**   | Number of texts you get per hour            | “How many events happen in a fixed time?” |

## 3 · Common Continuous Distributions

| Name                     | Everyday Picture                               | What it Answers                                          |
| ------------------------ | ---------------------------------------------- | -------------------------------------------------------- |
| **Uniform (continuous)** | Randomly pick a number between 0 and 1         | “Anywhere in this range is equally likely.”              |
| **Exponential**          | Waiting time for the next bus                  | “How long until the next event?”                         |
| **Normal (Gaussian)**    | Class test scores piling up around the average | “Most values cluster in the middle, fewer in the tails.” |

## 4 · Quick Cheat‑Sheet

- **Sum of chances = 1**
- **Discrete** → counts; **continuous** → measurements
- **Uniform** = “all equal,” **Bernoulli** = “single yes/no,”
  **Binomial** = “count the yeses,” **Poisson** = “events per time,”
  **Exponential** = “time until event,” **Normal** = “bell curve.”

### Takeaway

Probability distributions are simply different lenses for “how likely is what.” Learn the stories behind the big ones above, and you’ll have a solid toolkit for data, games, science—or even impressing friends at a (very nerdy) party! 🎲✨
