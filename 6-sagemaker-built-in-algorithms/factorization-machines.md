Factorization Machines (FM) are supervised learning algorithms adept at modeling interactions between variables in high-dimensional and sparse datasets. They extend linear models by capturing pairwise interactions among features without incurring the computational complexity typically associated with traditional methods. This capability makes FMs particularly suitable for tasks like recommendation systems and click prediction, where data sparsity is common.

**Relevant AWS Services & Features + Use Cases**

Amazon SageMaker offers a built-in implementation of the Factorization Machines algorithm, optimized for scalability and performance. Typical use cases include:
