**Factorization Machines (FM): Overview and Applications**

Amazon SageMaker's Factorization Machines is a supervised learning algorithm specifically designed for handling sparse data in recommendation systems and click prediction tasks. It excels at modeling pairwise interactions between features (like user-item interactions) while maintaining computational efficiency, making it particularly suitable for scenarios where data sparsity is common.

**Key Characteristics:**

- Supervised learning algorithm
- Supports both classification and regression tasks
- Specialized for sparse data scenarios
- Limited to pairwise interactions (e.g., user-item relationships)
- Particularly effective for recommendation systems
- Handles high-dimensional sparse data efficiently

**Training Input Requirements:**

- **Input Format:** recordIO-protobuf with Float32 data type
- **Data Characteristics:**
  - Designed for sparse data
  - CSV format not practical due to sparsity
  - Each record represents a feature vector
- **Mode Support:** Both file and pipe modes supported
