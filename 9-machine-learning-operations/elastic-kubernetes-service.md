## 1. Overview & Relevance to ML Workflows

**Amazon EKS** is a managed Kubernetes service on AWS. It enables you to deploy, scale, and manage containerized applications using Kubernetes—a widely adopted, open-source container orchestration system. In machine learning (ML) contexts, EKS is used to run scalable ML training jobs, deploy model inference endpoints, and manage complex pipelines, especially if your organization already has Kubernetes expertise or multi-cloud strategies.

- **Why It Matters for ML:**
  - **Standardization & Portability:** Since Kubernetes is cloud agnostic, ML workloads containerized for EKS can be more easily migrated or replicated across different cloud providers.
  - **Scalability:** Leverage Kubernetes’ native autoscaling capabilities to handle fluctuating ML workloads, from intensive training jobs to high-traffic inference services.
  - **Ecosystem Integration:** Utilize a vast ecosystem of Kubernetes tools and frameworks (e.g., Kubeflow) to orchestrate end-to-end ML pipelines.

## 2. Key Features & Launch Modes

EKS supports different modes for running containers, offering flexibility based on your control and management preferences.

### A. EC2 Launch Mode (Worker Nodes)

- **Managed Node Groups:**
  - AWS automatically provisions and manages EC2 instances as worker nodes using Auto Scaling Groups (ASGs).
  - Ideal if you prefer a hands-off approach to node lifecycle management.
- **Self-Managed Nodes:**
  - You create and manage EC2 instances yourself.
  - Use the Amazon EKS Optimized AMI or build custom AMIs for greater control.
- **Use Cases in ML:**
  - Deploy GPU-enabled EC2 instances for deep learning training or inference.
  - Fine-tune the node configuration for resource-intensive ML workloads.

### B. Fargate Mode (Serverless)

- **How It Works:**
  - Run Kubernetes pods without managing the underlying EC2 instances.
  - AWS Fargate automatically provisions and scales the infrastructure.
- **Use Cases in ML:**
  - Suitable for lightweight or bursty ML inference services.
  - Simplifies operational overhead by eliminating node management.

## 3. EKS Architecture & Components

### VPC & Subnets

- **Networking Setup:**
  - EKS clusters are deployed within a Virtual Private Cloud (VPC) that includes public and private subnets across multiple Availability Zones (AZs).
  - Ensures high availability and secure communication between components.

### EKS Nodes & Pods

- **Worker Nodes:**
  - These are EC2 instances (or Fargate instances) running the Kubernetes node agent.
- **Pods:**
  - The basic deployable unit in Kubernetes.
  - In ML workflows, pods can run containerized ML models, training jobs, or data processing tasks.

### Load Balancer Integration

- **Exposure & Routing:**
  - Integrate with AWS load balancers (e.g., Application Load Balancer, Network Load Balancer) to expose Kubernetes services.
  - Supports both public-facing and private applications, ensuring traffic is appropriately routed to ML inference endpoints or APIs.

## 4. Persistent Storage Options

EKS supports persistent storage integration through Kubernetes Storage Classes using the Container Storage Interface (CSI):

- **Amazon EBS:**
  - Block storage, ideal for stateful applications that require fast, low-latency storage.
- **Amazon EFS:**
  - Network file system that works seamlessly with Fargate; enables shared, persistent storage across pods in different AZs.
- **Amazon FSx Options:**
  - **FSx for Lustre:** Optimized for high-performance workloads.
  - **FSx for NetApp ONTAP:** Provides advanced data management features.

## 5. Practical ML Workflow Scenarios

### Scenario 1: Migrating On-Premises Kubernetes Workloads

- **Context:**
  - Your organization already uses Kubernetes for ML workloads on-premises.
- **Workflow:**
  - Migrate or extend your existing Kubernetes clusters to Amazon EKS, maintaining consistency with the Kubernetes API and leveraging AWS scalability.

### Scenario 2: Scalable Model Inference Service

- **Context:**
  - Deploy a model serving API that must scale with demand.
- **Workflow:**
  - Package your ML inference code in Docker containers, deploy them as pods on EKS (using either managed nodes or Fargate), and front the service with an Application Load Balancer for high availability and auto-scaling.

### Scenario 3: Distributed Training with Kubeflow

- **Context:**
  - Orchestrate complex, multi-step ML training pipelines.
- **Workflow:**
  - Use Kubeflow on EKS to manage distributed training jobs, leveraging Kubernetes’ orchestration features to schedule and monitor ML training across multiple nodes.

## 6. Challenges & Best Practices

### Common Challenges

- **Complexity:**
  - Kubernetes introduces a steep learning curve in terms of cluster management, networking, and storage configuration.
- **Resource Management:**
  - Balancing resource allocation across multiple pods to avoid under- or over-provisioning.
- **Security:**
  - Ensuring secure communication between components and managing access control (e.g., via IAM roles for service accounts).

### Best Practices

- **Cluster Management:**
  - Use managed node groups to reduce operational overhead and ensure consistent node configurations.
- **Monitoring & Logging:**
  - Integrate with AWS CloudWatch and Kubernetes-native monitoring tools (e.g., Prometheus, Grafana) to track performance and diagnose issues.
- **Security Best Practices:**
  - Use IAM roles for service accounts and follow Kubernetes security guidelines (e.g., network policies, RBAC) to secure your cluster.
- **Leverage Automation:**
  - Employ infrastructure as code (e.g., AWS CloudFormation, Terraform) for consistent and repeatable cluster deployments.
