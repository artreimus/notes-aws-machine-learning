# SageMaker Spot Training

## Overview

Amazon SageMaker Spot Training allows you to use Amazon EC2 Spot Instances to run your training jobs at a significantly reduced cost compared to on-demand instances. Spot Instances are spare EC2 compute capacity offered at steep discounts, but they can be interrupted by AWS with a two-minute warning if the capacity is needed elsewhere.

## How It Works

- **Managed Spot Training**:  
  SageMaker can automatically allocate Spot Instances for your training jobs. You can specify which jobs use Spot Instances and set a stopping condition (e.g., maximum wait time).
- **Checkpointing**:  
  Since Spot Instances can be interrupted, SageMaker supports checkpointingâ€”periodically saving the model state to Amazon S3. If an interruption occurs, SageMaker can resume training from the last checkpoint instead of starting over.
- **Automatic Retry**:  
  SageMaker will automatically retry interrupted jobs by obtaining new Spot capacity and resuming from the latest checkpoint.

## Key Features

- **Cost Savings**:  
  Spot Training can reduce training costs by up to 90% compared to on-demand pricing.
- **Seamless Recovery**:  
  With checkpointing, training jobs can resume from the last saved state, minimizing wasted compute time.
- **Flexible Scheduling**:  
  Spot Training is ideal for jobs that are flexible in terms of start time and duration.

## Best Practices

- **Implement Checkpointing**:  
  Always configure checkpointing to avoid losing progress if a Spot Instance is interrupted. Use the `CheckpointConfig` parameter to specify the S3 location for checkpoints.
- **Use Built-in Algorithms with Checkpointing Support**:  
  Some built-in algorithms (e.g., Object Detection, Semantic Segmentation, Image Classification) support checkpointing out of the box.
- **Set MaxWaitTimeInSeconds**:  
  Use this parameter to control the total duration (including wait time for Spot capacity) for your training job.

## Example Use Cases

- Large-scale training jobs where cost savings are important.
- Experimentation and hyperparameter tuning jobs that can tolerate interruptions.
